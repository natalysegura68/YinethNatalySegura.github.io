								    <p><br/>Price tracker is a project created in python using many of its libraries. This time I scraped amazon website, specifically a headlamp item that I have been needing for  hikes in the darkness.<br/>
										First I tracked the price for 15 days and appended all this data into a csv file and then, when the price dropped under $40 I automaticly got a notification email and a link to place the order. That's how I bought this item at the best market price.
